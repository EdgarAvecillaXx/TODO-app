# ToDo React APP

This is a To Do app made with React, it is mainly structured with Chakra UI and Bootstrap.
We have a adding task section and a view section to see and interact with our tasks.

## Content

This proyect has a simple estructure in wich we have 3 principal folders:

- node_modules
- public
- src

The first folder are our needed folders they stablished with react, and in case we add a new package the module will be installed in the node_modules folder.

### SRC folder

For the src folder we have:

- Components
- models
- styles

Here is stablished our proyect, in components we will see the father and child components.
For the models we will se js scripts for modeling the data needed
For styles we have simple styles for our tasks elements

## Preview

### Notes

ItÂ´s importante to teel that almost all styles like dark theme, postion, etc., was declared with
Chakra UI library, so many elements will have stablished the style with props in the labels like
this:
<example colorScheme='green' ></example>

In a few ones you will see a prop like this:

    colorSchemE={['green', 'green', 'green', 'red']}

this is a prop to established responsive design, in the first three breakpoint we have green color,
from 4th break will be red, Chakra UI stablished breakpoint based in bootstrap.
